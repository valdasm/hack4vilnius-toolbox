# hack4vilnius-toolbox

**Welcome at Hack4Vilnius hackathon**

I thought I'd compile a list of essential tools needed for Hack4Vilnius, or any other Hackathon as a reference to get back to and share with team mates and friends.

Being effective at a hackathon is all about efficiency. In this article I focus on different tools, tips and practices that will help your team be as efficient as possible in creating a gorgeous product MVP in 2 or 3 days.

Since a hackathon is not just about writing code, tools related to ideation, design, time management, resource sharing, and presentation are also discussed in detail.
